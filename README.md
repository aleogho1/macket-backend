# Backend - Trendit³

Trendit³ is a dynamic and innovative platform that provides users with an opportunity to earn money while engaging in a variety of daily activities.

This document provides information on the API endpoints for the Trendit³ application.

### Response Structure:

**Every API endpoint ensures a consistent response structure comprising:**

- `status` (string): Signifying the request outcome, either "success" or "failed".
- `message` (string): A message that conveys supplementary information regarding the request status
- `status_code` (integer): Represents the HTTP status code, reflecting the success or failure of the request.
    

These elements are foundational across all endpoints. For endpoint-specific details, refer to the individual documentation sections.


### Sending Form Data

Some endpoints will be recieving form data instead of the tranditional JSON data sent with every request.

Here is an example of how to send Form data to the update & create item endpoints:

``` javascript
const accessToken = "<access_token>"; // Retrieve stored access token
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('item_type', 'item_type');
formData.append('name', 'item_name');
// append other fields...

formData.append('item_img', selectedFile); // where selectedFile is a File object representing the uploaded image

fetch('/api/items/new', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
  headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});
```


## Pagination in API Requests
### Overview
When working with large sets of data, our API supports pagination to allow you to retrieve data in chunks (pages) rather than all at once. This helps with performance and makes it easier to manage large datasets on the frontend.

### Requesting Paginated Data
To request paginated data from the API, you will need to include the following query parameters in your request:

- `page` (optional): The page number you want to retrieve. Defaults to 1 if not specified.
- `per_page` (optional): The number of items to retrieve per page. Defaults to 10 if not specified.

### Example Request
```http
GET /api/resource?page=2&per_page=15
```
- `page=2`: This will return the second page of results.
- `per_page=15`: This will return 15 items per page.


### Understanding the Paginated Response
The API will return the data in a paginated format, which includes metadata about the pagination, along with the data for the requested page.

### Example Response
```json
{
    "current_page": 2,
    "total": 145,
    "total_pages": 10,
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 16,
            "name": "Item 16",
            "description": "Description for item 16"
        },
        {
            "id": 17,
            "name": "Item 17",
            "description": "Description for item 17"
        },
        // 13 more items...
    ]
}
```

### Response Fields:
- `current_page`: The current page number you are viewing.
- `total`: The total number of items across all pages.
- `total_pages`: The total number of pages available.
- `data`: An array containing the data for the current page.

## Implementing Pagination on the Frontend

1. **Initial Data Load:**
    - Start by loading the first page of data `(page=1)`.
    - Display the data on the frontend.

2. **Navigating Between Pages:**

    - Use the `total_pages` field from the response to determine the number of pages available.
    - Implement buttons or links for "Next", "Previous", "First", and "Last" page navigation.
    - Update the `current_page` parameter in the API request when navigating between pages.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**

    - **Empty Data:** If the `data` array is empty, this means there are no items for that page.
    - **Invalid Page Numbers:** If the user tries to navigate to a page beyond the `total_pages`, handle this gracefully by either showing a message or redirecting them to a valid page.

### Example Usage on the Frontend

```javascript
async function fetchPaginatedData(page = 1, perPage = 10) {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/resource?page=${page}&per_page=${perPage}`);
    const result = await response.json();

    // Handle the data
    displayData(result.data);

    // Update pagination UI based on result.page and result.total_pages
    updatePagination(result.page, result.total_pages);
}

function displayData(data) {
    // Code to render data on the frontend
}

function updatePagination(currentPage, totalPages) {
    // Code to update pagination controls (next, previous, etc.)
}
```

## Tips for Implementation
- **Optimizing Performance:** Load data for the next page in the background while the user is viewing the current page to make transitions smoother.
- **State Management:** Keep track of the current page in your application's state to ensure the UI reflects the correct page after navigation.

## Authentication Endpoints
This collection provides a general overview of the authentication process for the Trendit³ API V2. It outlines the steps involved in user registration, verification, login, and two-factor authentication (2FA).

Important Note: Separate documentation exists for each endpoint, providing specific details on request parameters, response formats, and error handling.

_**Usage:**_

- To register a new user, make a POST request to `/api/signup` with the user's email in the JSON format. A verification code will be sent to the provided Email.
- To verify a new user, make a POST request to `/api/verify-email` with the `entered_code` and `signup_token` in the JSON format.
- To complete registration, make a POST request to `/api/complete-registration` with the required user data in JSON format. This endpoint will completely add the user to the Trendit³ Database and automatically log the user in.
- To log in, make a POST request to `/api/login` with the user's email and password in the JSON format.
- To verify 2 Factor Authentication Code, make a POST request to `/api/verify-2fa` with the entered code and 2FA token. This endpoint is only needed if user enables 2FA in their settings.
- Upon successful registration or login, the server will respond with 200 status code. See below for details on how to access protected routes.
    

Please ensure that errors and exceptions are handled gracefully in the frontend application by checking the response status codes and displaying appropriate messages to the user.

#### Accessing Protected Endpoints

Upon successful login, the `/api/login` endpoint returns an access token(JWT) in the response. This token serves as a credential that identifies the authenticated user and grants them access to protected resources.

- To access a protected endpoints, you need to include the access token in the header of your request.
- Here’s an example using JavaScript:
    

``` javascript
const accessToken = "<access_token>"; // Retrieve stored access token
fetch('/api/protected', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error:', error);
});
 ```

If the JWT access token is valid, you will be able to access the protected route. If the token is missing, expired, or invalid, you will receive an error response.

Please note that the token is sensitive information and should be handled securely. Do not expose this tokens in publicly accessible areas.




### User Registration

**Endpoint:** `/api/signup`  
**HTTP Method:** `POST`  
**Description:** Register a new user on the Trendit³ platform.  
**Query Parameters:** `referrer_code` (optional)  


Include the following JSON data in the request body:
```json
{
    "email": "user_email@example.com"
}
```

A verification code will be sent to user's Email. After which you'll get a response with a `signup_token` and 200 status code.
The `signup_token` will be used to verify the user's Email in the `/api/verify-email` endpoint.

**Key Response Details:**

- `status`: "success" (string)
- `message`: "Verification code sent successfully" (string)
- `status_code`: 200 (integer)
- `signup_token`: A unique token used for email verification (string)

**A Successful Response Example:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Verification code sent successfully",
  "status_code": 200,
  "signup_token": "oikjasdkjsd;asmfdklksjdsaudjsamdsdsodsssd..."
}
```

**Error Handling**  
If registration fails, you will receive a JSON response with details about the error, including the status code.
- **HTTP 400 Bad Request:** Invalid request payload.  
- **HTTP 409 Conflict:** User with the same email already exists.  
- **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error:** An error occurred while processing the request.  

**_NOTE:_**  
The Trendit³ platform includes a referrer system, allowing users to refer others to the platform. Each referrer has a unique code *(username)* associated with their account, which is appended to the signup URL. The client side is responsible for extracting this code and including it as a query parameter when making the signup API request.

When a user visits the signup URL, such as `www.trendit.com/signup/dave2D`, the referrer code (dave2D in this case) should be extracted from the URL path.

#### Example JavaScript code to extract referrer code:

``` javascript
// Extract referrer code from the URL
const referrerCode = window.location.pathname.split('/').pop();
 ```

The extracted referrer code should be included as a query parameter (referrer_code) when making the signup API request. For instance, `/api/signup?referrer_code=dave2D`.




### Resend Email Verification Code
**Endpoint:** `/api/resend-code`  
**Method:** `POST`  
**Description:** Resend Email verification code.

If verification code wasn't sent to user' email when signing up, this endpoint can be used to resend the code. All that is needed is the `signup_token` gotten from the `/api/signup` endpoint above.

Include the following JSON data in the request body:
```json
{
  "signup_token": "oikjasdkjsd;asmfdklksjdsaudjsamdsdsodsssd..."
}
```

A new code will be sent to user's email and a new `signup_token` will be returned in the response. The new `signup_token` is what should be used `/api/verify-email` endpoint.
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "New Verification code sent successfully",
  "status_code": 200,
  "signup_token": "Zs9asd0DHJHFGaJKdsuiuaJKfJadjamdsdsmujo783sd..."
}
```



### User's Email Verification
**Endpoint:** `/api/verify-email`  
**Method:** `POST`

Include the following JSON data in the request body:
```javascript
{
  "entered_code": "entered_code" // code entered by the user
  "signup_token": "signup_token", // string (received from the sign up endpoint)
}
```
**Key Response Details:**

- `user_data`: A JSON object containing user information (e.g., user_id, email, potentially other details)

A successful response will look like this:
```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "User registered successfully",
    "status_code": 201,
    "user_data": {
        "user_id": 129,
        "email": "user@mail.com"
    }
}
```
You can then proceed to redirect the user to the complete registration page. The `user_id` will be required in that endpoint.

**Error Handling**  
If Email verification fails, you will receive a JSON response with details about the error, including the status code.
- **HTTP 400 Bad Request:** Invalid request payload.  
- **HTTP 409 Conflict:** User with the same email already exists.

-----
## Payment Endpoints
The Payment endpoints are use to Initialize payments & process payments, verify payments and get payment history.
(payments are handled using the Paystack Payment Gateway.) 

It includes endpoints to pay `"Membership fee"` and also to `credit user's wallet`.

_**NOTE:**_ Currently, payments are made only in Naira, and support for other currencies will be added later on. Documentation will updated when the support is added.




### Membership Fee
**Endpoint:** `/api/payment/membership-fee`  
**HTTP Method:** POST  
**Description:** Initialize a payment for Monthly Membership fee.  
**Login Required:** True

This endpoint will set up the payment process for `membership-fee`. A Paystack authorization URL will be returned in the response for the user to complete their payment. Once the payment is complete, the user will automatically be redirected back to the provided callback URL with a Transaction reference as the query parameter. For instance, after a successful payment, the user could be redirected to the provided callback URL:

`https://trendit3.vercel.app/homepage?trxref=bsvxk9cpxx`

As you can see there is `trxref` query parameter in the URL. This query parameter will be needed in the endpoint to verify payments. 

So to initialize payment, the amount is needed in the request's body:
```json
{
  "amount": 300,
}
```

If payment processing is successful, you will receive a JSON response with a 200 OK status code. The response will include an authorization URL. This is where you redirect user's to make their payments for membership. A successful response should look like this.
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "status_code": 200,
  "message": "Payment initialized",
  "authorization_url": "user_authorization_url",
  "payment_type": "membership-fee"
}
```

**Note:** It's crucial to include the `CALLBACK-URL` in the request headers. The backend code expects this header to be present to process the payment correctly. The CALLBACK-URL is where users will be redirected back to after completing their payment via the payment gateway.

**Example of including CALLBACK-URL using JavaScript:**
```javascript
fetch('/api/payment/membership-fee', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'CALLBACK-URL': 'https://example.com/payment/callback' // Replace with your actual callback URL
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    "amount": 300
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log(data);
  // Redirect the user to data.authorization_url
})
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```
**Ensure to replace 'https://example.com/payment/callback' with your actual callback URL in the JavaScript example.**

**Error Handling**  
If an error occurs in the process, you will receive a JSON response with details about the error, including the status code.

- **HTTP 406 Not Acceptable:** Payment type not supported.
- **HTTP 409 Conflict:** Payment already made.
- **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error:** An error occurred while processing the request.  



### Credit Wallet
**Endpoint:** `/api/payment/credit-wallet`  
**HTTP Method:** POST  
**Description:** Initialize a payment for a user to credit their Trendit wallet.  
**Login Required:** True

This endpoint sets up the payment process to credit the user's wallet. Upon successful payment processing, a Paystack authorization URL will be returned in the response for the user to complete their payment. Once the payment is complete, the user will automatically be redirected back to the provided callback URL with a Transaction reference as the query parameter.

`https://trendit3.vercel.app/homepage?trxref=bsvxk9cpxx`

As you can see there is `trxref` query parameter in the URL. This query parameter will be needed in the endpoint to verify payments. 

So to initialize payment, the amount is needed in the request's body:
```json
{
  "amount": 300,
}
```
If payment processing is successful, you will receive a JSON response with a 200 OK status code. The response will include an authorization URL. This is where you redirect users to make their payments to credit their Trendit wallet. A successful response should look like this:
``` json
{  
    "status": "success",
    "status_code": 200,
    "message": "Payment initialized",  
    "payment_type": "credit-wallet",
    "authorization_url": "https://user_authorization_url"
}

 ```
**Error Handling**  
If payment processing fails, you will receive a JSON response with details about the error, including the status code.

- **HTTP 401 Unauthorized:** User is not logged in.
- **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error:** An error occurred while processing the request.



### Verify Payment
**Endpoint:** /api/payment/verify  
**HTTP Method:** POST  
**Description:** Verify a payment for a user using the Paystack API.  


This endpoint is necessary immediately after being redirected from Paystack.  
As explained the docs above, immediately after payment, users gets redirected back to Trendit³ site, with a `trxref` query parameter in the URL. The value of this query parameter needs to be sent to `/api/payment/verify` in other to confirm that the payment was made. And if the payment was made successfully, the user record will be updated accordingly in the Trendit³ database.

Include the following JSON data in the request body:
```json
{
    "reference": "8j9onvy39z" // the value of trxref
}
```
The reference can be gotten from the arguments in the URL where user was redirected to after successful payment.

If payment verification is successful, you will receive a JSON response with a 200 OK status code. The response will include a message and payment details.
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "status_code": 200,
  "message": "Payment successfully verified",
  "activation_fee_paid": true,
}

Frontend developers are responsible for extracting this code and including it as a query parameter when making the signup API request.
