'''
1. Task Payment Processing:

Solution:
Implement a task review process where admins or designated moderators review submitted proof of completion before releasing payment.
Integrate with a payment processing service (like Paystack) to handle payment disbursement after successful verification.
Consider using a secure escrow system to hold the payment until the task is verified and completed.
Implement a dispute resolution mechanism for users to report fraudulent activities or disagreements regarding tasks.

2. Marketplace Transaction Management:

Solution:
Integrate with a payment processing service for marketplace transactions.
Implement an escrow system where the buyer's payment is held securely until the product is delivered and confirmed as satisfactory.
Partner with a shipping and delivery service provider or integrate with existing APIs for logistics management.
Implement a system for returns and refunds to handle customer complaints and disputes.

3. User Roles and Permissions:

Solution:
Define different user roles such as admin, moderator, advertiser, and earner.
Assign specific permissions to each role based on their functionalities (e.g., admin manages users and tasks, advertiser lists and manages task orders, etc.).
Implement access control mechanisms to restrict user actions based on their roles.

4. Security Considerations:

Solution:
Store sensitive user data like passwords and financial information securely using hashing techniques and encryption.
Implement access control and role-based permissions to restrict data visibility.
Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
Implement secure coding practices and follow best practices for data handling.

5. Scalability and Performance:

Solution:
Use caching mechanisms and optimize database queries to improve performance.
Implement a scalable architecture using horizontally scaling technologies like cloud platforms.
Monitor application performance metrics and identify bottlenecks for optimization.
Prepare for potential traffic surges and scale resources accordingly.

6. Testing and Deployment:

Solution:
Implement automated unit tests for your API endpoints and core functionalities.
Use tools like pytest and Flask-Testing for comprehensive testing coverage.
Consider continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
Choose a reliable hosting platform that can handle your expected traffic and performance requirements.
